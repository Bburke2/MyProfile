Hello, my name is Bradley Allen Burke, I am 21 years old and work as a casual for the Illawarra Retirement Trust (IRT) doing general home and garden maintenance. Some of my hobbies include: reading, cycling, pc gaming.

## **Interest in IT**

I am interested in IT because of its limitless potential and far-reaching impact. However, because of this i think i have always been rather intimidated by its ever-growing complexity and hesitant towards pursuing a career in it. The areas of IT which interest me the most are virtual and artificial reality, machine learning, as well as Holographic technology, which has always been a distinct interest of mine; and I always comment or critique on its depiction in science fiction films and media. The extent of my experience in IT is when i chose it as an elective for year 10 in high school, as well as some basic experience with eclipse using C++ to make basic programs, and watching youtube tutorials.

RMIT offers me the ability to study a University degree online, as my social anxiety has interfered with my attempt at on-campus study. I am taking this course because I want to have a more comprehensive understanding of what exactly is going on behind the scenes of software and ultimately information technologies in general. Whether it be software or hardware I want to feel like I can understand and communicate with the things I have for so long been in such close proximity too, but have only interacted with at the surface level as a consumer.

During my studies of Information Technology I expect to learn real-world skills and knowledge that reflects the current and emerging technologies in the industry. I expect to learn the fundamentals of software programming and ideally come to possess a thorough and eclectic understanding of IT that might allow me the potential to innovate within the many areas of the field. Ultimately I would like to attain a comprehensive understanding of the many aspects of IT as well as achieve a high level of competence within my interests and chosen specialisation of IT.

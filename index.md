## **Interest in IT**

I am interested in IT because of its limitless potential and far-reaching impact. Yet, because of this I think I have always been rather  intimidated by its ever-growing complexity and hesitant towards pursuing a  career in it. The areas of IT which interest me the most are virtual and  artificial reality, machine learning, as well as Holographic technology, which has always been a distinct interest of mine; and I always comment or  critique on its depiction in science fiction films and media. The extent of my experience in IT is when I chose it as an elective for year 10 in high school, as well as some experience with eclipse using C++ to make basic programs, and watching youtube tutorials.

RMIT offers me the ability to study a University degree online, as my social anxiety has interfered with my attempt at on-campus study. I am taking this course because I want to have a more comprehensive understanding of what exactly is going on behind the scenes of software and ultimately information technologies in general. Whether it be software or hardware I want to feel like I can understand and communicate with the things I have for so long been in such close proximity too, but have only ever interacted with at the surface level as a consumer.

During my studies of Information Technology I expect to learn real-world skills and knowledge that reflects the current and emerging technologies in the industry. I expect to learn the fundamentals of software programming and ideally come to possess a thorough and eclectic understanding of IT that might allow me the potential to innovate within the many areas of the field. Ultimately I would like to attain a comprehensive understanding of the many aspects of IT as well as achieve a high level of competence within my interests and chosen specialisation of IT. 


## **Ideal Job**

Although my ideal job would be to work from home, for the sake of this assignment I have chosen this position as a Backend Developer of open source databases via Cloud technology providers:

![Ideal job](https://github.com/Bburke2/MyProfile/raw/master/Images/Backend%20Developer%20Linux.JPG)

This job is for a position as a Backend developer of Linux based open-source databases through cloud technology providers, utilising mostly Python; but also Go, C, and Java/javascript, and HTML. This position interests me because there are a number of qualifications which I have just recently become interested in and started learning. These include Linux systems, the Python programming language, and the open-source aspect of software development; which is something I would like to contribute towards.

In order to qualify for this position or pursue a career in a similar area I will need to become familiar with Linux systems. Currently, I have no experience with Linux, however, I have recently just begun to learn it as I have installed the Ubuntu distribution of Linux onto my old Macbook Pro and will use this to begin learning. I will also need to be proficient with the Python programming language, which I have also just recently begun to learn. Thankfully, I have some minor experience with c++ programming, which is similar, and is aiding in my learning of the language. I will also require a skill set in web development and database technologies, as well as network management and systems administration skills in order to further establish my qualifications as a back-end developer. 

Because this job involves the use of cloud technologies, choosing to specialise in either ‘Security and Cloud Computing’ or ‘Data management’ will provide me with the necessary skills to qualify for this position. The ‘Web Programming’ (RMI-CPT270) subject can work as my official start to developing my web-based programming skills, with my focus being on back-end programming. I might also consider choosing ‘Web Development Technologies’ (CPT373) and ‘Web Database Applications’ (CPT375) as electives to further my experience and qualifications in Web and database technologies. Also, because the employer has emphasized their desire to “automate everything” I think it would be beneficial to choose ‘Scripting Language Programming’ (CPT223) as an elective subject. This subject will assist me in developing the skills needed to write software systems that can be automated.

## **My Profile**

![Myers-Briggs](https://github.com/Bburke2/MyProfile/raw/master/Images/Logician.JPG)
![Big 5](https://github.com/Bburke2/MyProfile/raw/master/Images/big%205.JPG)
![Visual Learner](https://github.com/Bburke2/MyProfile/raw/master/Images/Visual%20learner.JPG)

I took multiple Myers-Briggs personality tests along with the ‘Big Five’ test and the results showed that I am an INTP, being described as an extremely introverted person who enjoys conceptualising and contemplating ideas and theories about the world around me, though often times impractical and unrealistic; which is true. This personality type was described as being analytical in approach, preferring logical, objective analysis over emotional, subjective thought. They also confirm that I am more inclined towards thinking about abstract ideas and the ‘big picture’ and how everything connects together rather than the more pragmatic ‘down-to-earth’ approach. The test for my preferred learning style determined that I am predominantly a visual learner. This means that I learn best through visual stimulus like reading and seeing pictures or flash cards. I would agree with this assessment and also say that merely reading a description wouldn’t be enough for me to really remember something, I would also need to see an image or mindmap, ideally incorporating colours to remember it well.

Because I have a more introverted nature I am unlikely to play a leadership or managerial role within the group. Instead, I would prefer to remain behind the scenes and try to offer solutions or ideas where possible and contribute to the group this way. Also, because I am more objective focused I am less likely to fight or challenge a team member based on emotional interests or become emotionally charged. On the other hand, I am also more likely to offer ideas and solutions that are less realistic or pragmatic, often times becoming distracted with the end result or ‘what could be’.

Ideally, when forming a team I would look for outgoing, extroverted members to provide more social, communication, and management skills which I am not so inclined towards, so that I may effectively contribute to the group in the areas that I feel most comfortable. I also think that having team members who are more pragmatic in their approach and are less likely to over analyse, would provide a suitable balance to my less pragmatic nature that is likely to over analyse. Finding team members who share the same learning style would be good but not entirely necessary, as I think having team members who have different learning styles would actually benefit the team more. Our team would be able to offer a more engaging presentation if we incorporated more than one learning style into the presentation of our project.

## **Project Idea**

The project I have chosen is an artefact for a 3D, sandbox game model that allows players to see and change the games code from within the games GUI itself. The artefact aims to promote the learning of programming through an interactive game environment. The target audience for the completed game will be primarily, but not exclusively, children; and is intended to be extremely customisable and offer an enjoyable, hands-on learning experience.

Most game models hide the games mechanics behind the visuals and user interfaces to assist with immersion. However, because of this the player is unable to learn about what goes on beneath the surface of a games GUI (Graphical User Interface). Even the most dedicated player could never hope to learn about what goes on behind the graphics of their favourite game no matter how long they play. I therefore think that this could be an excellent opportunity to take advantage of this apparent disconnect between the player and their game by designing a model that connects the player to the heart of the game. This artefact could be useful in establishing a new form of game design. One that could provide an interactive platform for learning basic programming concepts and teaching children and veterans alike to code in an established game environment where they can see and interact with the code in an implemented, working program.

The artefact is for a 3D sandbox, survival game similar to Minecraft, except that the player has a device in-game that lets them see the code that makes up the environment around. They can earn and spend experience points to unlock and edit parts of the games code getting progressively more complicated the more they spent. To help visualise this artefact imagine Minecraft but you can see the Matrix through a device and interact with parts of it that you have unlocked. The player must level up to be able to unlock more functions and greater interaction with the more complicated aspects of the game. As players level up they get more options to potentially create custom tools and weapons and change its characteristics, attributes and aesthetics. The target audience for the completed game will be primarily children, though I imagine it will be the older players who explore the more complex aspects of the game. There are two main ways that players will be able to see and interact with the games code. One is to use the code itself and visually shape it like the physical entity it defines. A sword will be a block of its core code in the shape of a sword. When the player wants to interact with and alter the code of their sword they use their device to scan the sword, and depending on what they have unlocked, they can edit their swords code. The second way, and by far the easier way, would be to only display the code as it had been written. An axe will look like an axe, and when scanned will simply display the axes core code on the device like normal code looks in a program. The most effective and engaging way would be to do both. A sword looks like a sword but when it is being scanned by the device the sword appears to be made out of its core code, which can then be edited by the player. Things like the swords attack power and durability can be changed incrementally as the player invests more points. Colour distinction can be used to distinguish which parts of the code can be interacted with, and which parts cannot or are yet to be unlocked. The device can be used to teach programming by displaying lessons as the player progresses through the game. A completed game can incorporate greater customisation and include more complex coding like the creation of a new entity as well as more complicated lessons on programming.

An artefact of Minecraft could be used as a model to create, test and troubleshoot the concept without having to build an entire game from scratch. A repository on GitHub can be established to collaborate the project. Google Docs can be used to make a GDD or (Game Design Document) to coordinate the group and allow us to comment on and continually edit together as the project progresses.

Proficient experience with game development will be vital. The essential aspect of the artefact will be to display the code of, say for example a tree, and be able to edit and change its code without causing catastrophic errors in the game. What code can and cannot be changed will need to be clearly defined, heavily structured and thoroughly troubleshooted to safegaurd against game breaking errors whilst also ensuring the game remains challenging.

Ideally, the outcome of this project is to create an artefact for a game that will allow players to have an engaging, hands-on experience with programming that will encourage them to practise, test and experiment with code. I know that making an entire game or even a flawless artefact is quite an unrealistic idea for a project. However, I think that the concept of a game where the player can see and interact with the code from within the game itself could be a unique way of teaching programming through arguably the most enjoyable and engaging form of Information technology - video games.

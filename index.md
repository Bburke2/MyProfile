Hello, my name is Bradley Allen Burke, I am 21 years old and work as a casual for the Illawarra Retirement Trust (IRT) doing general home and garden maintenance. Some of my hobbies include: reading, cycling, and pc gaming.

## **Interest in IT**

I am interested in IT because of its limitless potential and far-reaching impact. Yet, because of this I think I have always been rather  intimidated by its ever-growing complexity and hesitant towards pursuing a  career in it. The areas of IT which interest me the most are virtual and  artificial reality, machine learning, as well as Holographic technology, which has always been a distinct interest of mine; and I always comment or  critique on its depiction in science fiction films and media. The extent of my experience in IT is when I chose it as an elective for year 10 in high school, as well as some basic experience with eclipse using C++ to make basic programs, and watching youtube tutorials.

RMIT offers me the ability to study a University degree online, as my social anxiety has interfered with my attempt at on-campus study. I am taking this course because I want to have a more comprehensive understanding of what exactly is going on behind the scenes of software and ultimately information technologies in general. Whether it be software or hardware I want to feel like I can understand and communicate with the things I have for so long been in such close proximity too, but have only interacted with at the surface level as a consumer.

During my studies of Information Technology I expect to learn real-world skills and knowledge that reflects the current and emerging technologies in the industry. I expect to learn the fundamentals of software programming and ideally come to possess a thorough and eclectic understanding of IT that might allow me the potential to innovate within the many areas of the field. Ultimately I would like to attain a comprehensive understanding of the many aspects of IT as well as achieve a high level of competence within my interests and chosen specialisation of IT. 


## **Ideal Job**

Although my ideal job would be to work from home, for the sake of this assignment I have chosen this position as a Backend Developer of open source databases via Cloud technology providers:

![Ideal job](https://github.com/Bburke2/MyProfile/raw/master/Images/Backend%20Developer%20Linux.JPG)

This job is for a position as a Backend developer of Linux based open-source databases through cloud technology providers, utilising mostly Python; but also Go, C, and Java/javascript, and HTML. This position interests me because there are a number of qualifications which I have just recently become interested in and started learning. These include Linux systems, the Python programming language, and the open-source aspect of software development; which is something I would like to contribute towards.

In order to qualify for this position or pursue a career in a similar area I will need to become familiar with Linux systems. Currently, I have no experience with Linux, however, I have recently just begun to learn it as I have installed the Ubuntu distribution of Linux onto my old Macbook Pro and will use this to begin learning. I will also need to be proficient with the Python programming language, which I have also just recently begun to learn. Thankfully, I have some minor experience with c++ programming, which is similar, and is aiding in my learning of the language. I will also require a skill set in web development and database technologies, as well as network management and systems administration skills in order to further establish my qualifications as a back-end developer. 

Because this job involves the use of cloud technologies, choosing to specialise in either ‘Security and Cloud Computing’ or ‘Data management’ will provide me with the necessary skills to qualify for this position. The ‘Web Programming’ (RMI-CPT270) subject can work as my official start to developing my web-based programming skills, with my focus being on back-end programming. I might also consider choosing ‘Web Development Technologies’ (CPT373) and ‘Web Database Applications’ (CPT375) as electives to further my experience and qualifications in Web and database technologies. Also, because the employer has emphasized their desire to “automate everything” I think it would be beneficial to choose ‘Scripting Language Programming’ (CPT223) as an elective subject. This subject will assist me in developing the skills needed to write software systems that can be automated.
